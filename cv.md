### About myself  

I have worked in a field far from software development for more than 10 years â€“ worked as an offline marketing specialist in different industries. During the Covid-19 pandemic, I started to think about career changing and moving into programming.  
In 2021 I was happy to be part of Sun Finance fintech startup team, where I was responsible for marketing. There I worked very closely with the development team, in particular with the front-end developers. This is inspired me, even more, to dive into software development. Since I have long gravitated towards my further development, I began to study the basics of HTML, CSS. And in summer 2021, I applied for the Programmer AyimdarII project, which is supported by KSSDA and EU in Kyrgyzstan. Having passed all three stages of selection, now I am studying Front-end development at IT Academy, Bishkek.
